# Blueberry-Desktop-Assistant

This assistant can open websites search google and also search youtube.

If you have an IDE that can run python, I would reccomend you to run the file through the IDE you have.
Also, if you get a message to configure a python interpreter just go to the microsoft store and install python 3.6
